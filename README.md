# Class 12 Result Analysis
I made this repository to visualise and analize the results of a certain section of a certain school in a certain city.

I can not actually upload the results of the students so the roll nos. have been redacted in the actual pdf.

The text file I extracted the data from also can't be uploaded to protect students' privacy.

# How I made this
- I first extracted the information from the original .txt file (not uploaded) and processed it to fill in specific content.
- Then I inserted this data into a Pandas data frame.
- Then I visualised using Matplotlib and Seaborn!
